 # `Step 4`
I clicked on the terminal and 
`The keys pressed:` `m4aziz@ieng6-201.ucsd.edu<enter>, cs15l<tab> to give cs15lwi24`
the reason I added the 201 was because that was one of the machines it worked on and originally it was connecting to machine 203 which wasn't letting me run.

# `Step 5`
`Steps taken:` `I went to github on browser, forked the repository, then I clicked the copy on the ssh url, and went to vs code and did git clone ctrl v`
I ran the first and second command to fork it, and the third because I needed to copy the url and the button was right there easy to access, for the 4th step I opened upvscode and in the terminal I git cloned the repository so I could have access with the files.`

# ` Step 6`
`Steps taken:` `ls<enter>, cd lab7/<enter>, ls, cat test.sh<enter>, bash test.sh<enter>`
first step showed me the directories and the lab7 which I wanted to access, I changed directory into lab7 to have access to the folders in lab7 and ls showed me which ones there were. I did cat on the test.sh file to see what was in that directory and there were test lines for me to run my code with. Then I run test.sh with bash and this the output that got printed was the output in my screenshot.

# `Step 7`

`Below is an image of the code previous to being fixed.`
