## `Student:`
![image](studentError)
Upon running my code, an `index out of bounds exception` is being thrown. With numerous variables in play, it's challenging to identify which one is causing the issue while traversing my sample array. I was hoping you can help me spot this error and give me some feedback on it. My guess is that my i or j variable is causing this array to get out of the range of length 3 for nums.

## `TA`
Based on the code you've provided, it seems that the issue might lie within the ranges used when iterating through the `nums` array inside your for loop. I suggest experimenting with the boundaries of the iteration over the `nums` array. Feel free to contact me if you have any further questions or need assistance.
